# Contact Form

This is a simple contact form implemented in HTML and CSS. It allows users to enter their name, email, and a message, and submit the form to send a message.

## Validation

The contact form includes basic form validation to ensure that the required fields are not left empty. The following validation checks are performed:

- The name field must not be empty.
- The email field must not be empty and should be a valid email address.
- The message field must not be empty.

If any of these fields are left empty, an alert message is displayed, and the form submission is prevented.

To see the form validation in action, try submitting the form without filling in any of the required fields, and you will receive an alert message prompting you to fill in the missing information.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the HTML file.
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
3. Fill in the required fields (name, email, and message).
4. Click the "Send Now" button to submit the form.

## Customization

You can customize the contact form by modifying the HTML and CSS code. To change the design, update the `style.css` file to match your desired styling.

Feel free to use this contact form as a starting point for your own projects or integrate it into your website.
